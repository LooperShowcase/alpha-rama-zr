        Blackpink is the most successful Korean girl group internationally and
        have often been dubbed the "biggest girl group in the world."[1] They
        are the highest-charting female Korean act on the Billboard Hot 100,
        peaking at number 13 with "Ice Cream" (2020), and on the Billboard 200,
        peaking at number one with Born Pink (2022), which is the best-selling
        album of all time by a Korean girl group and the first to sell more than
        two million copies.[2] They were the first girl group to top Billboard's
        Artist 100 and the first Korean girl group to enter and top Billboard's
        Emerging Artists chart.[3] Blackpink was also the first female Korean
        act to receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association
        of America (RIAA) with their single "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" (2018), whose music
        video was the first by a Korean group to surpass one billion views and
        is currently the most-viewed by a Korean group on YouTube.[4] Their 2018
        song "Kiss and Make Up", a collaboration with Dua Lipa, was the first by
        a Korean group to receive a certification from the British Phonographic
        Industry (BPI)[5] and a platinum certification from the Australian
        Recording Industry Association (ARIA).[6] The group's debut album The
        Album (2020) was the first album by a Korean girl group to sell more
        than one million copies and was the highest-charting female Korean album
        on the Billboard 200 at number two, both records that were surpassed by
        their follow-up album Born Pink (2022).[7] Born Pink was the first album
        by a K-pop girl group in history to reach number-one on the Billboard
        200 as well as the UK Albums Chart.[8] The album's lead single "Pink
        Venom" (2022) was also the first song by a Korean group to top the ARIA
        Singles Chart and the first song by a female Korean act to top the
        Billboard Global 200.[9]
